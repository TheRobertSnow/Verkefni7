      <p>A founder member of UEFA, Albania had never qualified for a major tournament until reaching UEFA EURO 2016, although there was a sign of things to come with improved recent results under experienced coaches like German Hans-Peter Briegel and Dutchman Arie Haan. Albania have not ended bottom of a qualifying group in their last seven campaigns; indeed, but for a poor finish to 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifying, they might have reached the play-offs under Italian Gianni De Biasi, the man who stayed on to steer them to France as Group I runners-up.<br></br></p>

      <p>Albania's introduction to the UEFA European Championship brought a famous win in a losing cause, a pattern that continued until UEFA EURO 2016 qualification. Having sat out the inaugural tournament, they achieved their first success in the competition against Denmark in the last 16 of the 1964 edition. A side led by perhaps the country's greatest player, Panajot Pano, won 1-0 in Tirana, but the Danes had already done the damage with a 4-0 first-leg victory.<br></br></p>

      <p>Four years later Albania again displayed their quality, albeit when already eliminated. They held West Germany 0-0 to deny them a finals place for the only time. Since then there has been only sporadic success, a 3-0 victory against Turkey in the run-up to the 1972 tournament and a memorable 3-1 win against Russia in 2003 the highlights. Albania recorded their best performance in UEFA EURO 2008 qualifying, collecting 11 points, but missed out on the finals; four years later, they finished second in their group behind Portugal to earn a first appearance.</p>

      <p>The halcyon days of Austrian football are in the distant past, with third place at the 1954 FIFA World Cup standing as a pinnacle of achievement. In all there have been seven World Cup appearances, the last of them at France '98, but just one until now at the UEFA European Championship – as co-hosts in 2008 when they endured group stage elimination after losing to Germany. Their cross-border rivals proved a stumbling back again in qualification for both UEFA EURO 2012 and the 2014 World Cup, but under Swiss coach Marcel Koller the team cruised to France, winning nine of their ten qualifiers and drawing the other.  <br></br></p>

      <p>UEFA EURO 2008 remains Austria's only tilt at the latter stages of the continental competition and it did not last long. In a tournament they co-hosted with Switzerland, Josef Hickersberger's young team paid for inexperience despite some spirited performances. They lost the opening game to Croatia and after picking up a draw against Poland, bowed out after the group stage following a 1-0 defeat by Germany.<br></br></p>

      <p>Until UEFA EURO 2016 Austria were never quite able to get across the line in qualifying, their 2012 campaign all too familiar when after a bright start they slipped to fourth. They came close, however, ending a point short of an automatic berth for the 1980 finals and twice defeats in the UK – 1-0 by Wales (1976) and 5-3 in Northern Ireland (1996) – ended their interest.</p>

      <p>Belgium ended a 12-year absence from major tournaments with an impressive qualification for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, their surge up the FIFA rankings earning them seeded status for the finals draw, where they reached the last eight. The good times continued for Marc Wilmots' star-studded side as they topped their UEFA EURO 2016 qualifying section. In France they will hope to match, or perhaps even better, the achievements of previous Red Devils selections. Highlights include a runners-up spot at EURO '80 and fourth place at the 1986 World Cup.  <br></br></p>

      <p>Belgium are now firmly back among Europe's elite having ended a three-decade wait to qualify for the UEFA European Championship, in which they were regulars during the 1970s and early 1980s. They finished third on home soil in 1972 and eight years later went one step closer to lifting the trophy, losing the Rome final 2-1 to a late West Germany goal.<br></br></p>

      <p>Since then the Red Devils have only managed two more group stage appearances, in 1984 and in 2000, when they were the tournament co-hosts, but failed to progress on both occasions. UEFA EURO 2012 qualifying came too early for Belgium's new wave, Georges Leekens' side never recovering from defeats in their first two Group A games as they finished third, two points shy of Turkey and a play-off spot. Now, though, they are four years older.</p>

      <p>Since seceding from Yugoslavia in 1991, Croatia have emerged as a force in international football. They qualified in their debut UEFA European Championship and FIFA World Cup campaigns, finishing third at France '98 where Davor Šuker was the six-goal top scorer. Croatia have become final tournament regulars, missing out only twice – in 2000 and 2010 – but have progressed beyond the group stage on just one further occasion, at UEFA EURO 2008. They qualified for the UEFA EURO 2016 finals – their fourth in a row – as runners-up to Italy in Group H.  <br></br></p>

      <p>UEFA EURO 2012 was Croatia's fourth European final tournament in five attempts since the break-up of Yugoslavia, their only failure coming in 2000. Inspired by three-goal Šuker, Miroslav Blažević's 1996 vintage reached the last eight in their maiden finals appearance, and the semi-finals beckoned in 2008 before Turkey's last-gasp equaliser and then defeat in the penalty shoot-out. There was more disappointment four years later as Slaven Bilić's side were narrowly edged out of a tough group by Spain and Italy, the eventual finalists.<br></br></p>

      <p>Croatia, of course, also contributed players to the Yugoslavia team that twice finished runners-up at the UEFA European Championship. They lost the inaugural showpiece 2-1 in extra time against the Soviet Union in 1960 and went down 2-0 to hosts Italy in a final replay eight years later.</p>

      <p>The Czech Republic have only been competing as an independent nation since 1994, yet in that time the country has qualified for every UEFA European Championship, finishing runners-up at EURO '96 – their first major tournament – and reaching the semi-finals of UEFA EURO 2004. In contrast their qualifying record for the FIFA World Cup has been disappointing, reaching only the 2006 tournament in Germany, where they were eliminated at the group stage. The former Czechoslovakia lifted the European title in 1976, defeating West Germany on penalties in the final, and were twice beaten finalists in the World Cup (1934, 1962).  <br></br></p>

      <p>The Czech Republic reached the quarter-finals at UEFA EURO 2012, their fifth EURO final tournament since the 1993 dissolution of Czechoslovakia. They lost the EURO '96 final to Germany, Oliver Bierhoff's golden goal inflicting a 2-1 defeat, and suffered more extra-time disappointment in the last four against Greece eight years later.<br></br></p>

      <p>En route to UEFA EURO 2000 they became only the second side to negotiate qualifying with a 100% record, only to exit in the group stage, as they would do in 2008. Not so in 1976, when Prague-born Antonín Panenka's memorable spot kick earned Czechoslovakia the European title with a 5-3 shoot-out victory against West Germany following a 2-2 draw in Belgrade. The Czechs came third in their championship defence four years later.</p>

      <p>England's recent record in major tournaments could have looked very different had it not been for penalty shoot-outs. Since losing on spot kicks to West Germany in the semi-finals of the 1990 FIFA World Cup in Italy, they have been eliminated by that method from five further tournaments – three UEFA European Championships (1996, 2004 and 2012) and two World Cups (1998, 2006). It means the 1966 World Cup triumph on home soil remains their only final appearance, although Roy Hodgson's team, group stage fallers at the 2014 World Cup, should travel to France in confident mood having qualified for UEFA EURO 2016 with ten wins out of ten.  <br></br></p>

      <p>England are alone among Europe's World Cup-winning nations in failing to capture the Henri Delaunay Cup. Indeed, they are yet to reach a UEFA European Championship final, having come closest in 1996, when they hosted the event, only to be denied by Germany in a semi-final penalty shoot-out defeat at Wembley. They also reached the last four – as world champions – in 1968, but otherwise the competition has brought few happy memories.<br></br></p>

      <p>In the four eight-team final tournaments from 1980 to 1992, England were unable to reach the knockout phase, failing to qualify altogether for the 1984 edition in France. EURO '96 apart, they have also struggled to make an impression in the 16-team finals, going out at the group stage in 2000 and suffering elimination in qualifying for the 2008 tournament. On the other two occasions, in 2004 and 2012, respective quarter-finals with Portugal and Italy both ended in shoot-out disappointments.</p>

      <p>Les Bleus have a happy habit of fulfilling expectations on home soil. They won the 1984 UEFA European Championship, when Michel Platini drove them to victory with a record-breaking final tournament haul of nine goals, and claimed the FIFA World Cup for the one and only time in 1998 when another famous No10, Zinédine Zidane, inspired them to victory with two goals in the final against Brazil (3-0).
Also winners at UEFA EURO 2000, and World Cup runners-up to Italy in 2006, France have struggled to make the same impact at recent major tournaments, falling at the group stage in 2008 and 2010 and exiting in the quarter-finals of UEFA EURO 2012 and the 2014 World Cup.<br></br></p>

      <p>France have been ever present in the EURO finals since missing out in 1988, an early end to the defence of the trophy they had lifted on home turf four years earlier. Their second victory came at UEFA EURO 2000, Roger Lemerre's side becoming only the second team after West Germany (1972, 1974) to hold the world and European titles at the same time.<br></br></p>

      <p>It was a close-run thing. Zidane's extra-time penalty settled a tense semi-final against Portugal before Sylvain Wiltord saved them from a showpiece loss to Italy with a last-gasp equaliser, setting the scene for David Trezeguet's golden-goal winner. Automatic qualifiers as hosts, France will attempt to join Spain on three EURO titles in 2016, having suffered a 2-0 defeat by La Roja in the UEFA EURO 2012 quarter-finals.</p>

      <p>A powerhouse of European football, Germany (West Germany from 1945 to 1990) have only once (1968) failed to qualify for the finals of either the UEFA European Championship or a FIFA World Cup that they have entered. They have won the World Cup four times, claiming the global prize in 1954, 1974 and 1990 and 2014, and became champions of Europe in 1972, 1980 and 1996. They have also been runners-up in three European Championships and four World Cups. Although it is almost two decades since their last EURO triumph, they have reached at least the semi-finals of the last two tournaments.  <br></br></p>

      <p>Three-time winners and runners-up in 1976, 1992 and 2008, Germany have won 23 of their 43 finals matches – all are records, though Spain also have three European titles to their name. UEFA EURO 2012 was Germany's 11th successive final tournament – also a UEFA European Championship record. Though in ominously good form in Poland and Ukraine – having won all ten of their qualifiers, scoring an average of 3.4 goals per game – they lost 2-1 to Italy in the semi-finals.<br></br></p>

      <p>Germany have advanced to the knockout stages in every one of their World Cup appearances but in the UEFA European Championship they have suffered group stage exits three times, finishing third in their section in 1984 and 2004, and bottom in 2000.</p>

      <p>Once giants of European and world football, finishing runners-up in the FIFA World Cups of 1938 and 1954 and claiming three Olympic titles, Hungary failed to qualify for 14 successive major tournaments after reaching the 1986 World Cup but ended that miserable run by making it through to UEFA EURO 2016 via the play-offs.
The golden age of Ferenc Puskás, József Bozsik, Sándor Kocsis and the rest of the Mighty Magyars, who reigned supreme in the 1950s, is a distant memory; Hungary finished third and fourth respectively in the UEFA European Championships of 1964 and 1972 but have not featured since.  <br></br></p>

      <p>Flórián Albert inspired Hungary as they finished third in 1964 and fourth in 1972. In 1964 they overcame Wales, East Germany and France before suffering a 2-1 extra-time semi-final defeat by Spain. Three days later Hungary prevailed 3-1 in extra time in the third-place play-off with Denmark, Dezső Novák scoring twice. In 1972 they overcame Romania in a quarter-final replay, but a late penalty miss by Sándor Zámbó confirmed defeat against the USSR and this time the third-place play-off ended in a 2-1 reverse to hosts Belgium.<br></br></p>

      <p>Hungary's next ten qualifying campaigns were unsuccessful, though under Sándor Egervári they finished a creditable third behind the Netherlands and Sweden in their UEFA EURO 2012 section. The highlight came in the home fixture against Sweden when Gergely Rudolf's 90th-minute goal earned a 2-1 victory. It was Hungary's first competitive win against a team above them in the FIFA world rankings this century.</p>

      <p>A team on the rise, constructed on the foundations of the talented Under-21 squad that qualified for the 2011 UEFA European Championship in Denmark, Iceland made history by reaching the qualifying play-offs for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Led by former long-serving Sweden head coach Lars Lagerbäck they finished second in their qualifying group, missing out on a place in Brazil after a 2-0 aggregate defeat by Croatia. It was their best ever performance in a major competition, eclipsing their valiant effort to qualify for UEFA EURO 2000 when only a last-day 3-2 defeat in France eliminated them – but even better was to follow as Iceland claimed second place in UEFA EURO 2016 qualifying Group A to reach a major tournament for the first time.  <br></br></p>

      <p>Iceland were slow to make an impression in UEFA European Championship qualifying, failing to record a victory in the 1964 preliminaries. Having not entered in 1968 and 1972 they earned just two wins in their next three campaigns, though the shock 2-1 defeat of East Germany in Reykjavik in 1975 hinted at their potential.<br></br></p>

      <p>Iceland's recent history reads much better. Ahead of UEFA EURO 2000 they recorded four wins as they amassed 15 points to run France, Ukraine and Russia close. Four years later they were even closer, missing out on the play-offs by a solitary point after winning half their eight fixtures. They finished second bottom of their UEFA EURO 2008 and 2012 qualifying groups.</p>

      <p>Europe's joint most successful nation in the FIFA World Cup with four victories, in 1934, 1938, 1982 and 2006, Italy have been crowned champions of Europe on just one occasion, back in 1968 when they lifted the Henri Delaunay Cup after a replayed final against Yugoslavia in Rome.
They have experienced mixed fortunes in the competition since then, failing to qualify in 1984 and 1992 but reaching the final in both 2000 and 2012. The Azzurri won their UEFA EURO 2016 qualifying group with room to spare, remaining undefeated in their ten matches to secure their place at the finals for the sixth time in a row.  <br></br></p>

      <p>Italy's sole UEFA European Championship success came in Rome in 1968 when, under coach Ferruccio Valcareggi and with Dino Zoff in goal, Yugoslavia were beaten 2-0 in a final replay two days after a 1-1 draw. The Azzurri came close to adding a second European title in 2000, Sylvain Wiltord's last-gasp equaliser for France denying them before David Trezeguet ended their dreams with an extra-time golden goal.<br></br></p>

      <p>There was more heartbreak in 2012, but a 4-0 loss to Spain was hardly close – indeed, that marks the most one-sided EURO final to date. Semi-finalists in 1980 and 1988, Italy have reached every tournament since 1992, when they were edged out by the Commonwealth of Independent States in qualifying.</p>

      <p>Despite some memorable wins, Northern Ireland had never sent a team to the finals of the UEFA European Championship until now, previously coming closest in the 1984 qualifying series when they beat holders West Germany home and away. In contrast there have been three appearances at the FIFA World Cup, the first in 1958 resulting in a quarter-final appearance and the second, in 1982, featuring a famous 1-0 win over hosts Spain. Like all-time top marksman David Healy, the great George Best sadly never graced a major tournament. The current crop, under manager Michael O'Neill, will get that opportunity to shine on the big stage in France.  <br></br></p>

      <p>Northern Ireland first entered the UEFA European Championship ahead of the 1964 finals, beating Poland 4-0 on aggregate before losing out to eventual winners Spain. Billy Bingham's side overcame West Germany 1-0 in Belfast and Hamburg during qualifying for the 1984 edition – only to be pipped to qualification by the Germans on goal difference.<br></br></p>

      <p>Fans also got a run for their money during the UEFA EURO 2008 campaign when Healy's prolific strike rate helped them to memorable home wins against eventual champions Spain (3-2), Sweden (2-1) and Denmark (2-1), but Northern Ireland could only finish third in their pool. Under Nigel Worthington they started UEFA EURO 2012 qualifying brightly, a 1-0 win in Slovenia and a 0-0 draw with eventual group winners Italy raising hopes, but the campaign ended in disappointment. A frustrating 1-1 draw in the Faroe Islands and a 4-1 defeat by Estonia in Tallinn did much of the damage.</p>

      <p>There had been a Polish presence at seven FIFA World Cups before the country finally qualified for a first UEFA European Championship final tournament, in 2008. As co-hosts for the 2012 event a second appearance quickly followed but, as on their debut in Austria, they failed to win a game and did not progress beyond the group stage. It was a different story in the 1970s and 1980s when, with world-class forwards Grzegorz Lato and Zbigniew Boniek to the fore, Poland reached four successive World Cups, collecting the bronze medals in West Germany in 1974 and again in Spain eight years later. Now the team possess another top-grade striker in Robert Lewandowski, who powered Poland to UEFA EURO 2016 with a record-equalling qualifying competition tally of 13 goals.  <br></br></p>

      <p>Poland qualified for a UEFA European Championship at the 13th time of asking after topping their 2008 qualifying group featuring Portugal, Serbia and Belgium. Leo Beenhakker's side made a limited impression in Austria and Switzerland, managing a goal – from Roger Guerreiro – and a point as they finished bottom of their section. <br></br></p>

      <p>Poland doubled both tallies as co-hosts at UEFA EURO 2012 but, once again, ended propping up the group, and having claimed second place in their UEFA EURO 2016 qualifying section behind Germany, they will hope for better in France. Before 2008 the closest the Biało-czerwoni had come to qualifying was in 1976 and 1980. In 1976 they missed out on goal difference to a Netherlands side that barred their path again four years later when they recovered from 2-0 down to beat East Germany and pip Poland by a point.</p>

Since then, with Cristiano Ronaldo an increasingly potent attacking force, Portugal have reached two semi-finals – at the 2006 FIFA World Cup and UEFA EURO 2012, losing in the latter to Spain on penalties.

      <p>Ireland qualified for their first major tournament in the 1988 UEFA European Championship, opening their campaign with a famous 1-0 win against England thanks to Ray Houghton's early header. They then held the Soviet Union 1-1 and Charlton's side were only edged out for a semi-final place in West Germany by an 82nd-minute goal for the Netherlands.<br></br></p>

      <p>Ireland narrowly missed out on the final tournament in 1992 and lost play-offs to the Netherlands and Turkey in 1996 and 2000 respectively. They finished third in their qualifying groups for both 2004 and 2008 but made the 2012 finals; beaten to an automatic place by Russia, they defeated Estonia in the play-offs. They had performed consistently throughout, at one point going eight matches (friendlies included) without conceding, establishing a new national record. Trapattoni's side arrived in Poland and Ukraine 14 games unbeaten, but that was soon forgotten as they lost 3-1 to Croatia, 4-0 to Spain and 2-0 to Italy.</p>

      <p>Having often encountered tough draws when they have reached the finals, Romania's EURO success has been limited although, having qualified unbeaten, Emeric Ienei guided his team through a group containing Germany, Portugal and England to reach the last eight of UEFA EURO 2000. It was a feat that Victor Piţurcă had a chance of matching eight years later after impressive draws against 2006 World Cup finalists France and Italy – Adrian Mutu scoring but later missing a penalty in the latter match – but beating the Netherlands in the final group game proved a step too far.  <br></br></p>

      <p>A slow start cost them the chance to make it to UEFA EURO 2012, draws against Albania and Belarus preceding a 2-0 loss in France. Răzvan Lucescu was succeeded six games in by Piţurcă, back for a third spell as national coach, and three draws and a victory in the last four matches both earned third spot and provided hope for the future.</p>

      <p>Since the break-up of the Soviet Union – the inaugural winners of the UEFA European Championship, in 1960, and runners-up in 1964, 1972 and 1988 – Russia have been regular qualifiers for the four-yearly continental gathering, but only once have they made it through the group stage. That was in 2008, when Dutchman Guus Hiddink's attractive side reached the semi-finals. In post-Soviet days they qualified for the FIFA World Cups of 1994 and 2002, and again for Brazil 2014. UEFA EURO 2016 qualification was achieved as Group G runners-up after new coach Leonid Slutski, a mid-campaign replacement for Fabio Capello, oversaw wins in each of the team's last four matches.  <br></br></p>

      <p>As part of the Soviet Union, Russia helped win the inaugural competition in 1960. A side containing FC Dinamo Moskva goalkeeper Lev Yashin and FC Spartak Moskva's Igor Netto beat Yugoslavia 2-1 in the final; striker Viktor Ponedelnik scored the extra-time winner. The USSR were runners-up to Spain in 1964, lost the 1972 final to West Germany and suffered more showpiece woe in 1988 as a Ukrainian-accented team went down 2-0 to the Netherlands.<br></br></p>

      <p>Since playing under the banner of the CIS in 1992, Russia have struggled to repeat past glories. They earned one win in nine finals games in 1992, 1996 and 2004 and failed to qualify in 2000, before a welcome return to form in Austria and Switzerland where they reached the semi-finals. UEFA EURO 2012 brought another group stage exit, despite opening with a 4-1 defeat of the Czech Republic and a 1-1 draw with co-hosts Poland. Needing just another draw, they lost 1-0 to Greece.</p>

      <p>Eight of the 11 Czechoslovakian players who started the 1976 UEFA European Championship final against West Germany – and triumphed on penalties after a 2-2 draw – hailed from Slovakia, but the country took time to find its feet since it began competing as an independent state. Glory did arrive, however, in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Vladimír Weiss's team not only topping their qualifying group but also knocking out holders Italy with a momentous 3-2 win at the final tournament in South Africa. Slovakia then broke their UEFA European Championship qualifying duck to reach the 2016 finals in France under coach Ján Kozák thanks largely to seven straight wins at the start of their campaign.  <br></br></p>

      <p>Slovakia's first three attempts to qualify for a UEFA European Championship each ended in a third-placed finish, their steady progress undermined by home defeats against Romania (twice), Portugal, England and Turkey. That trend of losing on their own turf continued in the UEFA EURO 2008 series when the Czech Republic (0-3), Germany (1-4) and Wales (2-5) inflicted heavy reverses.<br></br></p>

      <p>Weiss's charges were brimming with confidence in UEFA EURO 2012 qualifying, though, when they recorded back-to-back 1-0 victories against the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Russia. However, failure to score more than once in each of their ten matches, coupled with a 4-0 defeat at home to Armenia, put the brakes on an ultimately disappointing campaign – but success was to follow four years later, the highlight of their campaign a home win against holders Spain.</p>

      <p>After decades of underachievement following a UEFA European Championship triumph on home soil in 1964, Spain suddenly became world football's dominant force. UEFA EURO 2008, which they won with a 1-0 final victory over Germany, was followed by a first FIFA World Cup win two years later, in South Africa, Vicente del Bosque's side becoming the first European nation to lift the trophy outside their own continent.
Further history was made at UEFA EURO 2012 as Spain became the first team to retain the European title after overwhelming Italy 4-0 in Kyiv, although their World Cup defence ended in the group stage two years later. They are back to defend the Henri Delaunay Cup in France after topping their UEFA EURO 2016 qualifying group with 27 points out of a possible 30.  <br></br></p>

      <p>Spain's long wait for silverware ended in Vienna in 2008 as Luis Aragonés's side defeated Germany to win a competition they had taken by storm. Fernando Torres provided the decisive blow and four years later became the first player to score in two EURO finals as Spain, now under Del Bosque, successfully defended their title.<br></br></p>

      <p>They had become only the fifth team to complete a EURO qualifying campaign with a perfect record and crowned another memorable campaign with a record final win against Italy thanks to goals from David Silva, Jordi Alba, Torres and Juan Mata.
Prior to 2008 Spain had only once even reached the semi-finals – finishing runners-up in 1984 – since claiming their first major prize on home soil in Madrid in 1964. They won that year's final 2-1 against the Soviet Union at the Santiago Bernabéu. Marcelino Martínez headed a memorable winner six minutes from time after Galimzian Khusainov had quickly cancelled out Jesús María Pereda's sixth-minute opener.</p>

      <p>The only FIFA World Cup host nation to be defeated in the final, Sweden have never matched their run of 1958, but did make the last four in the only other tournament they have staged, EURO '92, the first time they had competed on that stage in the continental competition. They took bronze at the 1994 World Cup and although they have failed to qualify for the last two editions of the global finals, despite the elaborate gifts of star striker Zlatan Ibrahimović, they have reached the last five UEFA European Championships.  <br></br></p>

      <p>Sweden reached the semi-finals on home turf in 1992, beating eventual champions Denmark and England after an opening-day draw with France. However, with Stefan Schwarz suspended and Jonas Thern playing through injury, they were overwhelmed by Germany even if a last-minute effort made it 3-2.<br></br></p>

      <p>It was not until 2000 that they successfully negotiated qualifying to reach the final tournament, yet the Blågult have been ever-presents since. Sweden exited UEFA EURO 2004 unbeaten, losing 5-4 on penalties to the Netherlands in the quarter-finals after a goalless draw, while their last two campaigns ended at the first hurdle, a win and two defeats not enough each time. In 2012 they lost to Ukraine and England despite having led both matches in the second half, and were already out before their last game when Ibrahimović's brilliant acrobatic goal set up a 2-0 win against France.</p>

Their route to UEFA EURO 2016 was less straightforward, incorporating three defeats, but they eventually finished as comfortable Group E runners-up to England. All three of the country's UEFA European Championship final tournament appearances have resulted in group stage elimination, including the 2008 event they co-hosted with Austria.  <br></br></p>

      <p>For years, Switzerland were subject to a stream of slender defeats, until the appointment of Roy Hodgson signalled a change in fortunes. Having qualified for the 1994 World Cup, their first in 28 years, Hodgson then led the team to EURO '96 after topping a section containing Turkey and Sweden, although Artur Jorge took charge for the final tournament. They kicked off their finals by drawing 1-1 with hosts England, before consecutive defeats against the Netherlands and Scotland ended their campaign.<br></br></p>

      <p>Switzerland qualified again in 2004 under Jakob 'Köbi' Kuhn but garnered only one point, although Johan Vonlanthen did become the EURO's youngest goalscorer in a 3-1 defeat by France. They co-hosted the tournament with Austria in 2008 but failed to make home advantage count, losing against the Czech Republic and Turkey before overcoming Portugal 2-0. Opening defeats by England and Montenegro, and a campaign that yielded only two away points, undermined their UEFA EURO 2012 qualifying hopes, Switzerland finishing third in Group B.</p>

      <p>The pinnacle of Turkey's achievement came at the 2002 FIFA World Cup, where Şenol Güneş's side upset the odds to finish third. It was only their second World Cup appearance and they have not been back since. It took Turkey ten attempts to qualify for their first UEFA European Championship final tournament, and after losing all three matches at EURO '96 they reached the quarter-finals at UEFA EURO 2000 under Mustafa Denizli. They went one step further eight years later in Austria/ Switzerland, a dramatic penalty shoot-out win over Croatia putting Fatih Terim's team into the semi-finals, where they lost 3-2 to Germany. After missing out in Poland/Ukraine, they returned to the finals at UEFA EURO 2016 by qualifying as the best third-placed side over the nine preliminary sections.  <br></br></p>

      <p>Having not managed a win in their previous two qualifying campaigns, Turkey eventually reached a first finals at EURO '96, but Terim's men could not muster a point in England. They bettered that in 2000, battling through the group stage before a 2-0 quarter-final loss to Portugal. A play-off defeat by Latvia meant Güneş' Turkey missed UEFA EURO 2004 but with Terim back at the helm they starred at UEFA EURO 2008. Last-gasp victories over Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Croatia took them through to the semi-finals, where they finally met their match in Germany.<br></br></p>

      <p>Despite making a bright start to a tough Group A in qualifying for UEFA EURO 2012, losses in Germany and, more surprisingly, Azerbaijan put Guus Hiddink's side on the back foot. Turkey recovered to finish second ahead of Belgium but Croatia were too strong in the play-offs, a 3-0 first-leg win in Istanbul proving decisive.</p>

      <p>Ukraine was a prolific resource for the Soviet Union team that won the inaugural UEFA European Championship in 1960 and finished runners-up three times: losing to Spain (1964), West Germany (1972) and the Netherlands (1988). Ukraine had never qualified as an independent nation until now, but came within 12 minutes of reaching UEFA EURO 2000. Denied an automatic spot after a last-day draw in Russia, they were heading through on away goals in the play-offs before Miran Pavlin gave Slovenia a 3-2 aggregate win.  <br></br></p>

      <p>They had to wait until 2012 for their first appearance, participating as co-hosts with Poland. Blokhin's side enjoyed a dream finals debut, Shevchenko rolling back the years and raising the roof of Kyiv's NSK Olimpiyskyi with two predatory headers as Ukraine came from behind to beat Sweden 2-1. It was as good as it got as they went down 2-0 against France and 1-0 to England to bow out.</p>

They did reach the last eight of the 1976 UEFA European Championship but lost a two-legged tie to Yugoslavia and missed out on the four-team final tournament. Since then a plethora of top-class footballers, among them Ian Rush and Ryan Giggs, have been unable to represent the Principality on the biggest stage. However, thanks to the seven goals of Gareth Bale in UEFA EURO 2016 qualifying, the country will at last compete at a major tournament after a 58-year wait.  <br></br></p>

      <p>Yugoslavia were always Wales' bogey team in the UEFA European Championship, denying them a place in the four-team 1976 final tournament and then stopping the Dragons in their tracks in qualifying for the 1984 final tournament. Victory in the final home game would have taken Wales through but Mehmed Baždarević's 81st-minute leveller enabled the visitors to claim the qualifying berth.<br></br></p>

      <p>Not until UEFA EURO 2004 did Wales come as close again. Facing Russia in the play-offs, hopes soared after a 0-0 draw in Moscow only for a 1-0 home defeat to deny them once more. UEFA EURO 2012 qualifying proved to be a more troubled campaign than most, with promising results on the pitch overshadowed by the death of manager Gary Speed in November 2011.</p>
